## 🔧 Issues & Solutions

### **Issue #1: Widgets Not Showing**
- **Cause**: Added to CommandCentre.tsx but app uses CommandCentrePremium.tsx
- **Solution**: Added widgets to CommandCentrePremium.tsx

### **Issue #2: Roster Widget Failed to Load**
- **Cause**: Wrong column names in SQL query
  - Was using: `schedule_date`, `staff_assigned`
  - Actual columns: `date`, `profile_id`
- **Solution**: Updated SevenDayRosterDisplay.tsx to use correct column names
  - Changed: `schedule_date` → `date`
  - Removed: `staff_assigned` (each record represents 1 staff member)
  - Added: Proper counting logic for staff aggregation

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Query Implementation

**Calendar Widget** (from `sessions` table):
```typescript
.select('id, client_name, exam_name, date, candidate_count, start_time, end_time')
.gte('date', startDate)
.lte('date', endDateStr)
.order('date', 'start_time')
```

**Roster Widget** (from `roster_schedules` table):
```typescript
.select('id, date, shift_code, overtime_hours, status, created_at, updated_at')
.gte('date', startDate)
.lte('date', endDateStr)
.order('date', 'shift_code')
```

### Data Processing

**Calendar**: Groups sessions by date, displays up to 3 per day
**Roster**: Counts staff assignments per day, sums overtime hours
