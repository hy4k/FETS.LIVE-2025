# FETS Connect Feature Explanation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the features implemented in the FETS Connect page.

## 1. Supabase Integration

### Data Fetching

- **What it is:** Data fetching is the process of retrieving data from the Supabase database.
- **How it works:** We use the `useQuery` hook from TanStack Query to fetch data from Supabase. This provides several benefits, including caching, automatic refetching, and loading/error states.
- **Example:** The `usePosts` hook fetches all the posts from the `posts` table and caches the data. When the user navigates to the feed, the data is served from the cache, which makes the UI feel faster.

### Data Mutation

- **What it is:** Data mutation is the process of creating, updating, or deleting data in the Supabase database.
- **How it works:** We use the `useMutation` hook from TanStack Query to perform data mutations. This provides several benefits, including optimistic updates, error handling, and loading states.
- **Example:** When a user creates a new post, we use the `addPost` mutation to optimistically update the UI. This means that the new post is displayed in the feed immediately, without waiting for the server to respond. This makes the UI feel much more responsive.

### Real-time Subscriptions

- **What it is:** Real-time subscriptions allow the UI to be updated in real-time as data changes in the database.
- **How it works:** We use Supabase's real-time capabilities to subscribe to changes in the database. When a change is detected, we invalidate the relevant query, which triggers a refetch and updates the UI in real-time.
- **Example:** When a user likes a post, the `post_likes` table is updated in the database. The real-time subscription detects this change and invalidates the `posts` query. This triggers a refetch of the posts, and the UI is updated to show the new like count in real-time.

## 2. 'fets connect' Page Functionality

### Bug Fixing

- **What it is:** We have identified and resolved all reported bugs in the FETS Connect page.

### Feature Parity

- **What it is:** We have ensured that all existing features function as per the original design.

### Data Integrity

- **What it is:** We have implemented server-side validation (Supabase RLS) and client-side validation to ensure data integrity.
- **How it works:** We use `zod` to perform schema-based validation on all user inputs. This ensures that only valid data is sent to the server.

## 3. Component Refactoring

### Reusability

- **What it is:** We have extracted common UI elements and logic into reusable components.
- **How it works:** This promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, reduces code duplication, and improves maintainability.
- **Example:** The `PostCard` component is now a reusable component that can be used to display any post.

### Props

- **What it is:** We have defined clear and concise prop interfaces for all components.
- **How it works:** This improves the readability and maintainability of the code.

## 4. Form Handling

### Input Validation

- **What it is:** We have implemented schema-based validation for all form inputs.
- **How it works:** We use `zod` to define validation schemas for all forms. If the validation fails, we display a clear error message to the user.

### User Feedback

- **What it is:** We have provided clear validation error messages to the user.
- **How it works:** This helps the user to correct their input and submit the form successfully.

## 5. Performance Optimization

### Query Optimization

- **What it is:** We have used `select` to fetch only the necessary columns from the database.
- **How it works:** This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the server, which improves the performance of the application.

### Code Splitting

- **What it is:** We have implemented lazy loading for components and routes.
- **How it works:** This means that components and routes are only loaded when they are needed, which improves the initial load time of the application.

## 6. UI/UX Enhancements

### Loading States

- **What it is:** We have displayed spinners/skeletons during data fetching.
- **How it works:** This provides visual feedback to the user that something is happening in the background.

### Error States

- **What it is:** We have shown user-friendly error messages with retry options.
- **How it works:** This helps the user to understand what went wrong and how to proceed.
